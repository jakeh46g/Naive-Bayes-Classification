# Naive-Bayes-Classification

### This project gave me understanding in applying a supersived learing model on a dataset where features do not influence the presence of each other.

## Salmons.csv
### Salmons Stores operates a national chain of women’s apparel stores. Five thousand copies of an expensive four-color sales catalog have been printed, and each catalog includes a coupon that provides a $50 discount on purchases of $200 or more. Salmons would like to send the catalogs only to customers who have the highest probability of using the coupon. The file Salmons contains data from an earlier promotional campaign. For each of 1,000 Salmons customers, three variables are tracked: last year’s total spending at Salmons (Spending), whether they have a Salmons store credit card (Card), and whether they used the promotional coupon they were sent (Coupon).
